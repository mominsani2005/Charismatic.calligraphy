<strong style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;">Is the workshop just for beginners?</strong><br>
Yes and no. We start from the very beginning, no prior knowledge necessary.<br>

<strong style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;">What about lefties?</strong><br>
Pointed pen calligraphy is great for both lefties and righties. If you're purchasing your own supplies, make sure to order both straight and oblique holders. Look for the Speedball Oblique Holder. Melissa personally prefers to use a straight holder for lefty pointed-pen calligraphy. Markers for the brush class are not hand-specific<br>

<strong style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;">When can I start the course?</strong><br>
You can start today. We're serious. Make your purchase and start the reading immediately. You may even be able to start doing some pencil practice while you wait for your supplies to arrive.
The classes are entirely self-directed and on your own schedule. We provide the written material, videos, downloads and assignments. We give you assignment feedback whenever you ask for it.
Try to work your way through the material within about 30 days, but you can take as long as you like.
<hr>

<strong style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;">How long do your courses take?</strong><br>
Spend 2-4 hours per week going through coursework and practicing. It requires roughly 15-20 minutes per night.
Make sure that you complete the assignment prompts and upload your work. You don't need any fancy scans or photography... a simple snapshot with your phone or tablet will do fine.
Upload images of whatever challenges you're facing in addition to your normal assignment work. You have an expert in your corner, so please! take advantage of it.
Be sure to check out the introduction in each class with a recommended timeline for coursework.
<hr>

<strong style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;">Is the course on an individual basis?</strong><br>
Yes, it is! That's the beauty of it. You can access the course at any time and work at your own pace. Feedback is on an individual basis as well.
<hr>


<strong style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;">Who can see my assignments?</strong><br>
Assignment uploads are all private between you and your instructors. Students and alumni often post their work to the Charismatic.calligraphy.
<hr>

<strong style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;">When do you leave feedback?</strong><br>
We check in on Tuesdays and Fridays weekly starting at 9am . Every once in a while life can get the best of us (vacations, illness, holidays, etc) and we can’t get to feedback that day. You can always contact us if you're having trouble getting feedback.

<strong style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;">Is Charismatic.calligraphy amazing?</strong><br>
Of course! Instructor  has been teaching and developing this curriculum for years, and she knows what students need to get started. The web course has a nifty advantage over her face-to-face classes, because you get coursework, video instruction, practice materials, and Melissa's personal attention. Work your way through each lesson, complete the assignments, and upload your work for Melissa and the other instructors to critique.
